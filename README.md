# PPS

there is no draft of the working page, so I can only show the front-end
git hub pages  -  https://alexreshetnik.github.io/PPS/

This is a group project on the theme "Tourism Club", back-end built built on ะก# MVC

My task was to create the entire front-end part, which was then integrated into the back

Basic functionality is present:<br>
  registration<br>
  main page<br>
  pages with places
